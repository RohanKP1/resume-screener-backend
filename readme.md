Resume Screener Backend
This repository contains the backend service for an AI-powered resume screening application. The service processes resumes, extracts relevant information (e.g., skills, experience, education), and matches them against job descriptions using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques. It provides a scalable API for integrating with front-end applications or other services.
Features

Resume Parsing: Extracts key information from uploaded resumes (PDF format).
Job Description Matching: Uses NLP to compare resumes with job requirements and rank candidates.
API-Driven: Exposes RESTful endpoints for resume upload, analysis, and result retrieval.
Scalable: Built with [assumed framework, e.g., FastAPI/Flask] for high performance and easy deployment.
ATS-Friendly: Optimizes resume analysis to align with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) standards.

Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.8+
Framework: [e.g., FastAPI or Flask, assumed based on similar projects]
Libraries: 
NLP: spaCy, NLTK, or Hugging Face Transformers
Machine Learning: scikit-learn or TensorFlow
PDF Parsing: PyPDF2 or pdfplumber
Database: [e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, or none if file-based]


Dependencies: Listed in requirements.txt

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package manager)
Virtualenv (recommended for isolated environments)
[Optional: Docker, if the project supports containerization]
[Optional: Database, e.g., PostgreSQL, if used]

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/RohanKP1/resume-screener-backend.git
cd resume-screener-backend


Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configure Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the project root and add necessary configurations (e.g., API keys, database URL). Example:
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/resume_screener
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PORT=8000


Run the Application:
python main.py  # or `uvicorn main:app --reload` if using FastAPI

The server will start at http://localhost:8000 (or the port specified in .env).


API Endpoints
Below are the primary endpoints (assumed based on typical resume screening apps). Check /docs (e.g., http://localhost:8000/docs for FastAPI) for detailed Swagger documentation.
